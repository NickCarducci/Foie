        <br /> indexing home-prices is very significant to where you put the 100
        mark (unit), here is 1990, the middle of home-price-inflation
        exponential, consistent gain over cpi #inflation #CostOfLiving
        <br />
        Population cancels out when you cross multiply home-prices/population
        and hours-worked by those employed/population for
        inverse-home-price/hours-worked
